# AquaMqtt PCB Board

The AquaMQTT PCB Board is intended to be installed between the communication wires of the DHW HMI Controller and the DHW
Mainboard. To enable the communication to both HMI Controller and DHW Mainboard, the board provides two
individual [USART entities in One-Wire Mode](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/USART-in-One-Wire-Mode-ApplicationNote-DS00002658.pdf).
The Arduino ESP32 on the board runs AquaMQTT, providing communication via WiFi/MQTT while being powerful enough to
handle any time critical USART communication with the heat pumps hmi controller and main board.

The boards are designed using [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/). If you want to edit the layout, you may need to install an
additional [Arduino Kicad library](https://github.com/Alarm-Siren/arduino-kicad-library) before opening/editing the
project.

## Revision 2.0

<img src="./../img/board_v2_back.png" width=40% height=40%>

***Note*: Revision 2.0 needs AquaMQTT v1.7.0 or later for MITM mode**

This revision fixes an issue, where [certain heatpumps](https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT/issues/67) were not able to communicate due to a very sensitive serial link and changes of impedance. The Logic-Level-Converter and the one-wire USART circuit have been replaced by two [SN74LVC2T45](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc2t45.pdf?ts=1740403453841&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252Fde-de%252FSN74LVC2T45). Thanks to [@Arrnooo](https://github.com/Arrnooo) for debugging, verifying and providing a new design proposal.

Additionally, this revision adds optional RAST sockets. Thanks to [@tukutt](https://github.com/tukutt) for providing the design and custom adapters, originally used with revision 1.0 of the AquaMQTT board (see below).

### Buy Pre-Assembled

This board uses tiny SMD SSOP parts (SN74LVC2T45) so self-soldering is most probably an issue. This revision is meant to be bought pre-assembled from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)

1. Upload `AquaMQTT_Board_Revision_v2.zip` as *gerber file*
2. Enable "PCB Assembly"
3. Proceed and upload `AquaMQTT_Board_Revision_v2_BOM.csv` as *BOM*
4. Proceed and upload `AquaMQTT_Board_Revision_v2_CPL.csv` as *CPL*
5. Verify matched parts (should be good out of the box)
6. Verify component placement (should be good out of the box)

## Revision 1.0

<img src="./../img/board_front.png" width=40% height=40%>

<img src="./../img/board_back.png" width=40% height=40%>

**First revision, which is still good to use. There is no need to replace it with revision 2.0 in case it works for your heatpump.**

An optional DS3231 Real Time Clock might be added to the board. This might be handy in case AquaMQTT will be ever used without any HMI at all. It would ensure a recovery with correct date and time after power outage and without WiFi.
**Adding a RTC Module is experimental and untested!**

### RAST vs. 2x4 Connector

Your [heat pump](./../DEVICES.md) may use a different connector such as the Thermor Aeromax 5. Happily [@tukutt](https://github.com/tukutt) designed an [adapter pcb](https://oshwlab.com/tukutt/aquamqtt-original-pcb-to-rast-co) to connect those heatpumps without cutting any cables. Read more about this in [#51](https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT/issues/51).
