# AquaMQTT

AquaMQTT is designed for an ESP32 microcontroller running Arduino. The project offers two distinct operation modes: "
Listener" and "Man-in-the-Middle."

### Operation Modes

1. **Listener Mode:**
    - AquaMQTT acts as an observer, monitoring communication between a heat pump HMI controller and the heat pump main
      controller.
    - Parses the serial messages exchanged between the two controllers and publishes relevant data to specified MQTT
      topics (refer to [MQTT.md](../MQTT.md)).

2. **Man-in-the-Middle Mode:**
    - AquaMQTT intercepts and sits between the communication channels of the HMI controller and the main heat pump
      controller. 
    - Parses the serial messages exchanged between the two controllers and publishes relevant data to specified MQTT
      topics (refer to [MQTT.md](../MQTT.md)).
    - Enables the modification of communication messages in both directions, allowing for the alteration of
      various parameters such as operation mode, water target temperature, and more.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- [Arduino ESP32 Nano](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32)
- [AquaMQTT Board](../pcb/)

### Installation

1. Clone the AquaMQTT repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT.git
   ```

2. Configure WiFi and MQTT Settings:

   Open the `config/ExampleConfiguration.h` file and update the following parameters to match your WiFi and MQTT broker
   settings:

   ```c++
   namespace aquamqtt
   {
   namespace config
   {
      constexpr char     ssid[]           = "YourWiFiSSID";
      constexpr char     psk[]            = "YourWiFiPassword";
      constexpr char     brokerAddr[]     = "192.168.188.1";
      constexpr uint16_t brokerPort       = 1883;
      constexpr char     brokerClientId[] = "aquamqtt";
      // Leave blank if your broker does not require a username/password
      constexpr char brokerUser[]     = "";
      constexpr char brokerPassword[] = "";
      constexpr char mqttPrefix[]     = "";
   }  // namespace config
   }  // namespace aquamqtt
   ```

   Ensure that the WiFi SSID, password, MQTT broker address, and other parameters are correctly set.

   Additionally, set the operation mode within `config/Configuration.h` to either LISTENER or MITM, depending of your [Wiring Configuration](../WIRING.md).

   ```c++
   constexpr EOperationMode OPERATION_MODE = EOperationMode::MITM;
   ```

### Flashing

1. Install PlatformIO IDE

   https://platformio.org/install

2. Build the project using

   ```bash
   pio run -e arduino_nano_esp32
   ```

3. Connect the Arduino and upload the project to your microcontroller via USB

   ```bash
   pio run -t upload -e arduino_nano_esp32
   ```

**Note:** If you are using the cheaper esp32 [esp32-s3-devkit-c1](https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT/issues/56) instead of the Arduino Nano ESP32, use the environment `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` instead of `arduino_nano_esp32`

### Over-The-Air Update

1. Determine the IP-Address of your AquaMQTT device

   **Note:** If you already have MQTT up and running, AquaMQTT will publish the IP-Address to `aquamqtt/stats/ipAddress`

2. Adapt `platformio.ini` accordingly:
   ```ini
   # uncomment the below lines to use over the air update
   upload_protocol = espota
   upload_port = 192.168.188.62
   ```

3. Upload
    ```bash
   pio run -t upload -e arduino_nano_esp32
      ```
