# AquaMQTT

[![PlatformIO CI](https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tspopp/AquaMQTT/actions/workflows/main.yml)

AquaMQTT is a project designed to monitor and control your DHW heat pump locally using MQTT.

## Features

- Access sensor data and operational states from your heat pump.
- Control the heat pump: Set operational states e.g. water temperature and operation modes.
- Automate the behavior of your heat pump according to your local energy production or energy availability.
- Easily integrate AquaMQTT with smart home systems like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Compatible Devices


AquaMQTT is designed and tested with the [Windhager AquaWin Air3](https://www.windhager.com/en/products/hot-water-tanks/aquawin-air3/) DHW heat pump. While specifically tailored to this model, it's highly likely that AquaMQTT is compatible with similar heat pumps manufactured by the [Groupe Atlantic](https://www.groupe-atlantic.fr/) and branded for various companies.

Potential compatible devices include, but are not limited to:

- [Atlantic Explorer](https://www.atlantic-comfort.com/Water-Heaters/Heat-pump-water-heaters/Explorer)
- [Austria Email Explorer](https://www.austria-email.de/produkte/waermepumpensysteme/waermepumpen-trinkwasser/explorer-evo-2/)
- [Thermor Aeromax](https://www.thermor.com/our-solutions/renewable-energy-solutions/heat-pump-water-heaters/aeromax-premium)
- [Panasonic DHW270](https://www.aircon.panasonic.eu/CH_de/model/paw-dhw270f/)

If you have a heat pump with similar characteristics or branding, AquaMQTT might be compatible. Feel free to explore and adapt the project for your specific device, and share your experience.

## How does it work?

AquaMQTT facilitates communication between the HMI controller and the main controller of your heat pump. The project intercepts the serial messages exchanged between these controllers, extracts and parses identified values, and publishes them via [MQTT](./MQTT.md). For a detailed description of the heat pump's serial protocol, refer to [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md).

To achieve this communication interception, an Arduino-based microcontroller is introduced between the communication lines of the HMI controller and the main controller.

AquaMQTT not only monitors the heat pump's status but also provides the capability to control it by modifying the messages originating from the HMI controller. This allows you to set operational states, such as water temperature and operation modes, directly through AquaMQTT.

In summary:
- AquaMQTT intercepts and processes serial messages between controllers.
- Extracted values are published via MQTT.
- An Arduino-based microcontroller facilitates communication interception.
- AquaMQTT can modify messages to control the heat pump's operational states.


## Getting Started

To get started with monitoring and controlling your heat pump, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware (AquaMQTT Board):**
   - Before proceeding, make sure to place an order for the custom PCB with a manufacturing company. You can locate the KiCad files and further instructions within the [pcb](/pcb) folder.

2. **AquaMQTT Software:**
   - [Install AquaMQTT to your Arduino ESP32 using PlatformIO](AquaMQTT/README.md).

3. **Wiring Instructions:**
   - Follow the instructions in [WIRING.md](./WIRING.md) to integrate the AquaMQTT Board into your heat pump. This document includes details on connecting the PCB to the HMI controller and the main controller.

## Why not using cozytouch / io-homecontrol?

Unfortunately, I had no success pairing those solutions with my Windhager branded heatpump.

## Roadmap

- [x] Prototype: Control the heat pump (replaces original HMI controller)
- [x] Prototype: Control the heat pump (man in the middle)
- [x] Final hardware, board layout and instructions
- [x] AquaMQTT first release
- [ ] Wiring Instructions
- [ ] HomeAssistant configuration
